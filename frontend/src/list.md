I start my day with high priority tasks. This might be something left over from the day before, or an urgent bug that needs to be fixed. We use Scrum for agile planning and time tracking, so I’ll get the next project from Scrum and start tracking my time. 
##
We do also practice pair programming, for troubleshooting or starting a new project. depending on the task at hand, I might sit with one of the other developers so we can work on it together. Once I’m done with a task, I submit my code for review. I upload it to the testing server and to GitHub with a comment on what I’ve done and why, any changes I’ve made and instructions on how to test it. I’ll then mark it for review so that my team sees it. We operate a policy whereby all code has to be reviewed by at least one other team member. Once I’ve submitted my code for review, I’ll stop the time tracking in Scrum and move that task to the QA column.

##
The biggest challenge of my productivity on a daily basis is definitely the ad-hoc requests I get from other teams. Slack can be really distracting, but it’s also a communications tool we just couldn’t do without. It’s important to manage other people’s expectations and to balance the act of responding to urgent error reports, and knowing when to shut yourself off and focus on the larger projects.

Finally, I wouldn’t be nearly as effective at my job if I didn’t like our product. Being passionate about what the company does keeps me motivated from day to day: I go to work each morning knowing that what I’m working on has a direct and visible impact. I can see things improving as a result of my work, and that’s really satisfying.
